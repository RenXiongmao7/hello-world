*My name is Lorenzo Lozada. I'm 20 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll down roughly one bottle of Zyrtec while doing my push-ups. I can do about two now. After I wait for my stomach to settle, I drink a copious amount of water.</p><p>In the shower, I use a steel wool brush that I gently scrape along my body. Then I apply an herb-mint lotion masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after-shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then I eat breakfast, which consists of a handful of multivitamins and a cup of powdered proteinâ€”no milk.*
